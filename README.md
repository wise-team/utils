# Utils made by Wise-Team

Almost every project want's grown up, become a big boy with dozens of features, thousands of users, and own repository.

Some of our projects listed [here](https://wise-team.io/#projects) are already much bigger, but projects in this repositories need to wait for that.

But because even a small project (which sometimes is needed for internal use) can be useful and helpful for others, and because we believe in open-source movement, therefore we share results of our work with you here.

## Created Accounts

In hardfork 20, Steem introduced a change which allows people to _claim and create discounted accounts_. 

On https://utils.wise-team.io/accounts/ you can find a simple dashboard, which helps analyze information related with this process :)
